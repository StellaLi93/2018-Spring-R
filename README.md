In the animal shelters, some get to be adopted by a loving family, whereas some are not. It is very important for the shelter to know whether the pet is more or less likely to be adopted, so they are able to make future decisions. In this project, the goal is to figure out correlation and which factors have influence on potential pet adoption, for instance, the petâ€™s sex, age, color, etc.
There are 3 major steps for this project: pre-analysis, modeling, and outcomes.
In the stage of pre-analysis, the main procedure is data manipulation, which transforms string variables into categorical variables, and reduce the number of categories, so that the predictors are functional without causing problems to the model, i.e., insignificance, multicollinearity, and overfitting. Meanwhile, we use scatter plot matrix to visualize the correlation between different variables. Missing values are processed by MD imputation. 
In the stage of modeling, we use logistic regression model to predict which variables have influence on potential pet adoption. Feature selection are also used to pick reasonable scales of predictors.
